## Prelim objective
This study aims to investigate the relationship between income inequality and gun related deaths of minors in Puerto Rico.
Over a 15-year period (2006-2021), the prevalence of firearms as the primary cause of death among minors (1-19 years old) will be assessed. 
Geographic distribution patterns of firearm related deaths among minors will be analyzed to identify associations with neighborhood income levels.
The index of concentration at the extremes will be utilized to evaluate the degree of income inequality linked to these occurrences. 

The study seeks to determine whether there is a noticeable trend indicating that homicides are more likely to happenin low-income neighborhoods.
